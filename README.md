# Docker In Real Life
This is a presentation about using Docker In Real Life projects. It leverages the awesome [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) framework.

## Prerequisites

Reveal.js is included as a git submodule so that it can easily be updated. Therefore, remember to initialize the git
submodules before doing anything else:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Starting the presentation

To start the presentation, run the following command in the root of the repository:

    ./start_presentation.sh

Now, you can access the presentation slides with your browser by going to:

    http://localhost:8000

To show the speaker notes, just press the `s` key while you have a presentation open.

To view the presentation in fullscreen mode, press `f`.

To view the overview mode, press `Esc` or `o`.

For more details, refer to the [Reveal.js documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
